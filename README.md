# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Abstract:

The challenge's significance to us as college students, especially in Boston, motivated us to take it on. To move around the enormous city, we frequently use ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft and knowing how their pricing structures operate and change depending on the situation helps us decide which ridesharing service to employ. The analysis conducted by our team compared 750,000 rideshares between Uber and Lyft in Boston, Massachusetts. Furthermore, the knowledge we have gained from this dataset will be extremely useful in solving real-world problems using data science and machine learning methods. In our analysis, we forecasted and analyzed the cost of ridesharing services from Uber and Lyft using several factors, including distance, time of day, surge multiplier (demand-based pricing), etc. We can see that Lyft has a lower rate for distance than Uber, which suggests that Lyft generally costs less for every extra mile and that long-distance rides will be less expensive on Lyft than they would be on Uber.

Introduction


For a sample set of 750,000 rideshares, our team's analysis focused on contrasting Uber and Lyft rides in Boston, Massachusetts. We were motivated to take on this task because it was pertinent to us as Boston-area college students. We frequently use Uber and Lyft rideshares to move around the enormous city and knowing how these pricing models operate and change depending on the situation helps us decide which ridesharing service to employ. We therefore decided to take a road
make a taxi reservation, and Uber was the only choice that occurred to us. However, when we looked at the overall cost of the vacation, we were astonished because it was much higher than we had anticipated. The next choice was Lyft, which offered some promise because it was slightly less expensive than uber services. Nevertheless, we chose Uber because it is a well-known and internationally renowned corporation. After this occurrence, we made the decision to research this subject and determine how much rides cost on Uber and Lyft. Who doesn't like to save money? The information from this study will assist customers decide whether to use Uber or Lyft in certain
pricing strategy and that of their competitors. Additionally, the knowledge we have gained from this dataset will be very useful for employing data science and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. The purpose of this study is to develop a model for estimating fares for Uber and Lyft in the Greater Boston area. For the two businesses, we develop several linear regression models, and we contrast the variations in their pricing approaches. Based on a range of factors, including distance, time of day, surge multiplier (demand-based pricing), and others, we forecasted and compared the cost of Uber and Lyft rideshares. We obtained our data from Kaggle and
